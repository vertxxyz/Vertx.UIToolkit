# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1]
 - Removed BetterFieldMouseDragger's y axis to avoid glitchiness associated with Unity's dodgy implementation.
 - Added FocusController.IsInputFieldFocused

## [1.1.0]
 - ApplyBetterFieldMouseDragger has moved to BetterFieldMouseDragger<T>.Apply(field). The extension method was being too liberally applied.
   To use Apply on composite fields T has to be the manipulated type. Eg. for Vector3Field that is float.
 - Added VisualElement.SetDisplay to avoid repeatedly doing style.display = value ? DisplayStyle.Flex : DisplayStyle.None;

## [1.0.0]
 - Initial release.
