## [1.3.0]
- Added IStyle extensions: SetBorderWidth, SetBorderColor, SetBorderRadius

## [1.2.1]
- Added a context type to IsInputFieldFocused to query whether numerical or text fields are focused.

## [1.2.0]
- Added InspectorElementQuery
    PropertyFields can be queried from the root of a InspectorElement.FillDefaultInspector, and a callback is fired when initialised.

## [1.1.1]
- Removed BetterFieldMouseDragger's y axis to avoid glitchiness associated with Unity's dodgy implementation.
- Added FocusController.IsInputFieldFocused

## [1.1.0]
- ApplyBetterFieldMouseDragger has moved to BetterFieldMouseDragger<T>.Apply(field). The extension method was being too liberally applied.
    To use Apply on composite fields T has to be the manipulated type. Eg. for Vector3Field that is float.
- Added VisualElement.SetDisplay to avoid repeatedly doing style.display = value ? DisplayStyle.Flex : DisplayStyle.None;

## [1.0.0]
- Initial release.
